a)Iteration and recursion are similar in finding same results. They are different in running different part in the program. Iteration algorithm has more repetitions.
b)The most executed line in recursive algorithm is line 149 which is 15300. The most in Iteration algorithm is also line 149 which is 20400.
c)For recursive part, line 7-8, 12-26, 18, 21-23, 26-27, 32, 88-89, 131, 161-166, 168-171, 173, 175, 178, 182-183, 185-186, 190-191, 194-195, 197-201, 205-207, 209, 212-216, 218, 221, 223-225, 228-229, 234, 236, 239, 241-243, 247-249, 251-253, 255-256, 258-259, 263, 272-277 have not been executed.
  For iterative part, line 12-16, 18, 21-23, 26-27, 32, 190-191, 194-195, 197-201, 205-207, 209, 212-216, 218, 221, 223-225, 228-229, 263, 276-277 have not been executed
d)It should be the main functioning part, which is the part that searches for numbers' factors.
