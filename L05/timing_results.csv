1,0m0.007s,0m0.006s,0m0.007s,the reason why times are the same is that all of datas are uniformly distributed in the array and the amount of data is still too few for computer 
4,0m0.007s,0m0.008s,0m0.007s,the reason why times are the same is that all of datas are uniformly distributed in the array and the amount of data is still too few for computer

996639,0m0.007s,0m0.006s,0m0.007s,the reason why times are the same is that all of datas are uniformly distributed in the array and the amount of data is still too few for computer 
996652,0m0.009s,0m0.008s,0m0.007s,Fibonacci Search is the fastest, the reason could be that 996652 is in the end of the array.
